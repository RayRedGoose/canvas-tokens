## First-Time Contributions

If you're a first-time contributor, welcome! We use the
["good first issue" label](https://github.com/workday/canvas-tokens/labels/good%20first%20issue)
to identify issues that you can pick up any time. If the issue is unclear, feel free to reach out in
our #canvas-kit-contrib Slack channel. We're happy to help you get started! If there are no
`good first issue`s, we always appreciate documentation updates. If our docs are unclear,
incomplete, or incorrect, you can submit a pull request to make an update. If you'd like to work on
something else, please reach out in our #canvas-kit-contrib Slack channel, and we'll help you find
something. Please read our contribution guidelines below for more detailed information on making a
contribution.
